# Introduction

It is a small tool to write and validate regluar expression that I wrote long long time ago.

It's useful to me and someone may like it, so I extract it from old code repo and build it to a standalone tool.

Please star it if you like it.

Please raise git issue if you want new functions, or you can submit a PR to enhance it by yourself.

Thanks, Walter
